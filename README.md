**Project 4**
The purpose of this app is to provide recommendations for people that watch movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Many people that watch the movies become interested in the comics but aren't sure where to start. This app will allow them to see suggested comics and let them add suggestions for movies and characters they want to see in the next movies. This app is for anyone that enjoys movies from the MCU and would like to leave a suggestion or start reading the comics themselves.
